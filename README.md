Pure RSpec
==========

My presentation at Scottish Ruby Conference 2010.


Description
-----------

Code cleaner RSpec using the latest features and patterns:  let, subject,
shared examples, shoulda, and more.


Abstract
--------

Go beyond the well-worn fundamentals of RSpec.  No more will you simply set a
bunch of instance variables in before-each blocks.  We'll explore the latest
(and apparently not-super-well-known) features of RSpec.  And not just
technical syntax, but also the higher-level patterns and refactorings implied.
Topics include:  let, subject, its, expect, shared examples, shoulda matchers,
stub_chain, unstub, spork, rspactor, and havering on.
